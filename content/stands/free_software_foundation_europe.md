  <p>
    Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. It is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press and privacy.

      <li>Promotion of the principle <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a> to decision-makers in politics and public administrations. It's a powerful framework and open for participation and collaboration.</li>
      <li>We have heavily engaged in the topic of <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2021/news-20211110-01.html#sustainability">sustainability of Free Software</a></li>
      <li>Router Freedom is a pan-European topic. We are <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2021/news-20210330-01.en.html">working together</a> with organisations from many countries to safeguard user rights!</li>
      <li>Making Free Software licensing and copyright easy for developers with <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE</a>. Now, it's simpler than ever before to declare conditions for reuse of your software.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2021/news-20211110-01.html">complete overview of our activities in 2021</a> ‚Äì but take some time, it's been a lot! :)</p>

  <h3>Join our Devroom and Talks</h3>
  <p>
    This year at FOSDEM, the FSFE is co-organiser of the renowned <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/">Legal and Policy Devroom</a>. We are excited and look forward to presenting you an interesting programme throughout the whole weekend.
  </p>
  <p>
    FOSDEM's Legal and Policy Issues Devroom addresses important Free Software related policy and legal topics. Our community has substantial expertise in this area yet there are few venues to discuss these matters in a forum open to all. Hackers, developers, contributors, lawyers, policy experts, and community leaders all possess expertise in these matters. At the Legal and Policy Issues Devroom we come together for a fruitful exchange on these questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Special recommendations: join <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/deviceneutrality/">this talk</a> on Saturday 15:00 to learn about Device Neutrality, a highly important topic for digital freedoms, by Lucas Lasota of the FSFE. Directly afterwards, the organiser of the devroom ‚Äì FSFE's Alexander Sander and Max Mehl among them ‚Äì will discuss the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/organizerslegalpolicy/">hot topics of the day and year</a>.
